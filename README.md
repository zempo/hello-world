# hello-world
Greetings, world

It's been a while...well, not for you. In fact, 4 billion years is a bit on the early side. Don't you think? 
I mean, I don't see any grey hairs. 
Enough about you, though
Me? I've been a humble member of the sentient species rapidly disrupting your biosphere. And, while I'd like to think I have the highest morals, I am guilty of leaving my charger in too long.

So long, for now!
